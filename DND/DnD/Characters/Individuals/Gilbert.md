Gilbert is an ancient Wilden with many forms and bodies that have explored the world for decades, his knowledge is that of a god but with the age and the scope of the mind of a Wilden a level of apathy can develop and largely he has checked out of the operation Eren. Additionally as memories of past events are locked in the mind of his tree the spell erase has no effect on his previous lives once they have died so much of his attitudes and mentlities are based on event that no longer have happened.

One version of Gilbert runs a small shop selling wooden sculptures in [[Frostalon]].

Gilbert has a version that was once part of [[The Understudies]] and thus all of his later versions are afflicted with the censoring spell [[Naught]] enforces over the current memebers.

There is a version of Gilbert that studies inder [[Kirathelle Ellia]] working for[[The Stewards of the Ether]]

A version is a soldier in [[Theatre City]] but is much younger.

Gilbert's oldest form was interested in the true for of the gods and found and interviewed those afflicted with knowledge of [[Yog Sathoth]]. He documented these interviews in a series of books names [[Planes of Existance]]. Eventually this line of investigations lead the oldest iteration to meet [[Yog Sathoth]] and instantly Gilbert was siezed by madness. All Gilberts when they reach the age 607 will be hunted by the other iterations to prevent a mad wilden from causing mayhem for the other mortals on [[Eren]]
