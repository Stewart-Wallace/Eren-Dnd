He is 33 but has lived many lives, from peasent to aristokrat, from pirate, smuggler and theif, to, now, being an upstanding trader across the [[Merchant's Waters]]. Prior to his owner ship of The Endurance, Raven was a Quarter Master on [[The Rosehip Thorn]], a ship on the [[Merchant's Waters]]. After a disagreement with the captain, [[Captain Rosen]] after they were caught for smuggling, Raven and many of the crew accompanied him to pull their funcds to buy The Endurance. With a larger stake in the ship Raven became the captian. The crew agreed to find a seperate Quarter Master as a ship works better with a working relationship between a captain and a quarter master.

## Relationships

- [[Eross]]: Currrently dating Eross and Raven have a very intermittent relationship as Raven is regularly travelling for work, but this suits Eross's focus on her work too.
- [[Ptosse]]: In addition to being the first hand on The Endurance, Ptosse and Raven are only friends and have spent many years in one anothers company. They have both devoutly turned from a life of crime but Ptosse still hold on to a crippling gambling addition that Raven often has to help pay for.
- [[Aather]]: Sister to Eross Raven is scared of her however, the relationship he has with Eross has clearly lead to a very profitable situation, he just worries that Aather thinks he is only in the relationship to benefit from their export.
