# Northerners for Equality
Northerners for Equality are a charitable group that ravel to remote regions of [[The Iron North]] to bring aid to disenfranchised communities. Though their work does not explicitly involve violence they often are found in the company of [[The Stout Defenders]] to help bring order to an area. One of their key tenants is that those in remote communities should have the same access to learn the arcane and organise opportunities for young people with magical talents or inate magical abilities. They have no center of operations but can be identified by a necklace of a brown stone half dipped in a chromatic metal. In special cases it has been rumoured that they have been laid siege upon for protecting people in crisis. In the core of [[The Iron North]] there are many rooms in inns that provide freelodging for the Northerners for Equality.
