# The Abjurers
The Abjurers are an organisation that work with [[The Stewards of the Ether]]s at a more local level. They travel and teach methods of defending oneself against the arcane. Much of their training consists of making people aware of components and the relevance of components for particular spells and how to recognise the use of spells. They also sell one-time use counterspell tiles that have the power to counter spells of level 5 and below in a radius about them for those wanting an additional level of protection. They have centers about [[The Iron North]] where those unwillingly affected by magical enchantments can come to have their enchantments removed with lesser restoration of the use of disspell magic. Initially these sites were met with resistance for the freedom of magic to be used wherever and indivuidaul had learned to use it but public opinion has changed and [[The Abjuration Clinics]] are open and frequently guarded by local law enforcement
