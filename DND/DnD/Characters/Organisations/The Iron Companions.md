# The Iron Companions
The Iron Companions are a guild of mercenaries that seek to stabilise [[The Iron North]] and seek to take jobs on moral weight above all else. It is believed that a more uniformly prosperous Iron North would feel more inclined to separate from [[The Theatre]] and unify. The Companions rely mostly on martial prowess and avoid the use of the arcane as in smaller communities magic can be considered agift from the capital. Many members if the Iron Companions wear about their necks rust laden iron nails to show allegiance with the separatist movement present in [[The Iron North]].
