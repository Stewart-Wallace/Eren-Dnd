# The Stewards of the Ether
The Stewards of the Ether operate across [[The Theatre]] and beyond. They are a trusted band of powerful magical users and researchers. Their location of operation is not publicly known but they have a school in [[Theatre City]] where abjuration and counter magic is thought at a price. The group are in charged with protecting the public from the most dangerous sources of magic and appointed by the [[Thespians]] more than 200 years ago. The Stewards track and store items of arcane significance and power, they were recently publicised for destroying a whole neighbourhood in the holy city of [[Bonsai]] to detain a magic user and confiscate an unknown magical deck of cards.

The leaders of The Stewards of the Ether, of which there are four, are named. [[Peripous Smith]], [[Logan Almayo]], [[Kirathelle Ellia]], [[Ullillillia Uthuell]]. These figures are public facing and appear in much news surrounding the Stewards. Beyond them there are [[Regional Proprietors]] to which any member of the public can report arcane objects and spells that appear unceremonious in their power. Above all things else the Stewards of the Ether are tarnished with a rumour of brutality and corruption and those disconnected from, or disenfranchised by, the leadership of [[Theatre City]], are unlikely to go to the organisation for assistance. This is most abundant in [[The Iron North]] where the Stewards only have a single proprietor in Sycamore, [[Threlle Abornant]].
