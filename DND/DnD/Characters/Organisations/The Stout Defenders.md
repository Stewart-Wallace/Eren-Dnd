# The Stout Defenders
The Stout Defenders are an organisation of well trained mercenaries. In civil disputes the [[Theatre City]] have used the Stout Defenders to bolster thier numbers. The leader of The Stout Defenders is a man by the name of [[Reginald Thunderbloom]]. In the eyes of most citizens the Stout Defenders are seen as unjust armour bought by the money the rich steal from the poor. Much of the people of [[The Theatre]] when they see the red and black cloaks of the defenders want more than anything to attack those that have bought for their protection, especially in the remote villages and hamlets of [[The Iron North]].
