Duo met [[Scaith]], [[Tem]], [[Rytir]], and [[Kai]] in [[Frostalon]] while hunting the ex member of [[The Understudies]], Octus. The group worked well together and Duo gained their trust but expanded their knowledge of the world at large and accidentlly left them with several powerful scrolls. While the body of Octus was erased the group were in the Ethereal plane under the gaze of [[Yog Sathoth]], which protected them from it's effects. 

Duo is on-script and loyal to [[The Understudies]]. Originally from [[Eberon]], he was expelled for accidentally unleashing a plauge on the realm. [[The Understudies]] have lied to him that working for their oganisation may one day leadd to him having enough favour to return home. He believes that sorting out the timeline in the present can save [[Eren]] from the [[Re-Sync]]. 

## Future Duo

Future Duo has learned that the [[Re-Sync]] comes and goes and nothing stops Eren being thrust into the void and the eventual [[Cataclysm]]. In the future Duo will join [[The Stewards of the Ether]] to attempt to prevent the worst effects of the Cataclysm. 

If the party succeed to send the [[Deck of Many Things]] to the [[Underdark]] then Future Duo will have joined [[The Stewards of the Ether]] sooner and actually push the party to damage the timelines of other realms to encourage a more amicable [[Re-Sync]]
