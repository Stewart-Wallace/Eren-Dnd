# The Wayward Men
The Wayward Men are a locally organised group of wizards and sorcerers that manage an intricate network of teleportation circles. The group are public facing but difficult to find. A journey on their network can cost anything from 1000gp and they are ruthless against anybody using their circles without permission and frequently hire [[The Stout Defenders]] to track ’Stowaways’. In addition to providing instantaneous transport to the public there are rumours that they work with guards to bring in fugitives that attempt to use their system to escape from the law. As there is no leader and the group is generally locally run no local agency has information of the entire network. Cross continental travel or travel to a capital can generally be facilitated at any of their facilities but to reach a more remote location several journeys may be needed. In the past maps of the system had been published in closed societies however these were generally destoryed by request of the groups as they felt it contained too much information of the workings of the Wayward Men.
