# Town Guards
The town guards of any location must adhere to local laws and customs and are free to hire people from local or outwith the bounds of their influence. Every town is different with how the guard operate and so favour with one may not be transferable. One might find that the heads of guards know one another and have opinions about those that they keep in their company. Additionally [[Theatre City]] can impose that a particular individual work in a specific location often replacing or moving guard captains. A public tenant of the guards of any given location is that they are not actively political figures such that the guards of a settlement do not serve as a political militia. Many guard captains find this a difficult tread to walk along as wielding power within a location frequently adds weight to ones political beliefs so many attempt to limit how public they are so to keep their position in the guard.
