The Linch Family are a group of Intellect vampires. Their home is in [[Meer]] and they find themselves satiated on productive and mindful conversation in their presence. They make their wealth exclusively from the sale and export of [[Shatter Stone]] which they mine and purify from dredging the sands of [[Waters#Merchant's Sea]]. 

With their wealth they find and bring people of great note to their family home where they use their own hypnotic abilities to unify their main room into a sub-planar realm where they feast on the minds of their victims.
