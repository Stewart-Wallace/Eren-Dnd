# Eren
The planet on which the game is set is created of five contents. [[The Theatre]],[[Pethra]], [[Nectal]], [[Menthria]] and [[Oathra]]. The continents are defined, not by a global council, but by the people that live within them, as such, the definite borders of these continents are argued upon. The history of the world has been mostly forgotten but in recent centuries the invention of the printing press in [[Oathria]] has began to etch away the layers of time on many ancient stories.
