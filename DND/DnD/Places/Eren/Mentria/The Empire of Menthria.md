# The Empire of Menthria

The Empire of Mentria predates much of the world that is known now. Little is known about the empire and it's dimensions are ill defined but in the past there was a military powerhouse that originated in the land that is now [[Mentria]]. This force expanded north and south consuming [[The Theatre]] and [[Pethra]]. Eventually the empire crumbled, nothing is known about why the empire faded but the genuine belief of many anthropolgists is that the army just decided to disband.

This is true in reality the civilisation became more interested in aquiring pure truths and there in they lost their fever for conquest.
