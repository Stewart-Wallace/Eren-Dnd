# Aspen
Aspen is the largest state of [[The Theatre]], by far. The sparsely populate region exports mostly pelts and rare animal goods, due to its domination of the northern most region of [[Eren]]. The economic activity from [[Places/Eren/Theatre/The Iron North/Aspen/Frostalon]] has spurred on a new economic interest and investment in the state’s capital [[Emberhill]].The Eastern part of Aspen is connected by an incredibly long trail called ’[[Roads#The Icy Way]]’ that connects the mildly separatist East to the loyal Unionist West. Despite places like [[Permission]] in the West being physically further from [[Theatre City]], the city operates closely with towns in the region. From [[Laddle]] in [[Ash]], [[Theatre City]] can send aid or deploy troops if needed via a well known public teleportation circle. Aspen’s Regent is a figure by the name of [[Gerald Smith|Gerald ’The Baron’ Smith]].  [[Rose#The Icy Way]] is peppered with tiny settlements that do not appear on maps but bolster the most remote populations throughout [[The Theatre]]. In the South-East of the state there is growing influence from the holy city of [[Bonsai]]. Specifically a growth in the followers of [[Helm]], the God of Protection. This has lead to a more fluid transportation of goods along with neighbouringstates and several new churches to be built
