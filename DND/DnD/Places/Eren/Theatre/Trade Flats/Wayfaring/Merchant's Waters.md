The Merchant's Water is a busy sea within the theatre, though much of the trade for [[Merchant's Peril-Pearl]] does not make it through the [[Waters#Merchant's Choke]] there are still many vessels that travel from [[Merchant's Peril-Pearl]], [[Bitterling]], and [[Meer]] and other smaller settlements.

Though there are few pirates or any battling nations on the coast of the Merchant's Waters some nafareous groups have been known to intercept groups and precious cargo on the waters most notably [[The Rosehip Thorn]], a merchant vessel.
