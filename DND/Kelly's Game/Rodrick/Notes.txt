Crystal has fallen in the fey wild
from the far wild
dulian has sent scouts to investigate
scouts are probably dead - names Thurlea, Doreen
bring back the crystal and the scouts if alive
araceli in the meadow of lost souls
north of a swamp to the roaring mountain
swamp is west of the roaring mountain.
Message Dulian to return

Pins of the two scouts were found on hags in the swamp, unclear if they even got to the mountain
