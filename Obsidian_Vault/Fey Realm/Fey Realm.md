The Fey Realm is populated by Elves. The populated region of the infinite plane is surrounded by the [[Fey Wild]] which is a chaotic forest and stormt hat swirls infinitely ouside of the cities and towns of the Fey Realm.

The Fey Realm is lead by the [[Fey Court]] which is made of smaller sub-courts. Eventually these lead to the Fey Lords and Ladies. 

The attitude of the Fey of the Fey Realm is that of lazy apathy. The Fey Realm is inhabited by ageless beings, living in the central city [[Nielen Mor]] they are imortal and even a brief time in the city can rejuvinate the most aged elves. Because of this the inhabitants are not skilled at handeling quick and decisive issues. Though they may be slow to decisions the plane is one with one of the fastest times and the army may take millenia to build and train but when in battle the Fey are fierce and beyond skilled than almost any other plane.

The people of the Fey realm spend their time reviling in existance, dance, poetry and song are considered the most valuable part of a persons soul and some [[Arch Fey]] may trade coin for a heart felt song or an inspiring dance. The further from [[Nielen Mor]] one ventures the more mortal the mentalities become. Some Fey even engage in trade and industry at the fringes of the realm. 

Beyond the perimeter of the realm there are a few arch fey, lords and ladies, that have created bubbles of normality in the chaos storm where they practice untold arcane paradies and use the [[Fey Wild#Folk of the Wilds]] to their own will.
