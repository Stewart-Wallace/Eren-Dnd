The Fey Wild is a deep auburn and burple forest that shimmers and glistens in the wilds of fait that bluster through the branches. On the edges of sanity in the [[Fey Realm]] one might hear the screams of those forever locked in the chaotic magic that embues the forest with untold horrors. 

There are those that travel the forest and hunt. These are generally creatures that are deemed undesired in the [[Fey Realm]], [[Satyrs]], [[Minitaurs]], [[Dark Elves]], and [[Teilfing]] all find themselves in the Chaos eventually.
